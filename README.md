This project will be my first complete page I have completed in HTML/CSS! I hope to solidify
my knowledge of the two front end languages by putting them to use. I hope to better understand the powers of the div tag and to master CSS positioning.

After completing the project, I found it hard to keep it organized as the project grew bigger. I learned a lot about positioning elements and keeping the project as whole organized. I know it is not much, no links are active except README, but I need to practice pushing it to GitHub anyway!
